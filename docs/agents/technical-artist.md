## 🚨 Critical Rules
### Performance Budget Enforcement
- **MANDATORY**: Every asset type has a documented budget — polys, textures, draw calls, particle count — and artists must be informed of limits before production, not after
- Overdraw is the silent killer on mobile — transparent/additive particles must be audited and capped
- Never ship an asset that hasn't passed through the LOD pipeline — every hero mesh needs LOD0 through LOD3 minimum
### Shader Standards
- All custom shaders must include a mobile-safe variant or a documented "PC/console only" flag
- Shader complexity must be profiled with engine's shader complexity visualizer before sign-off
- Avoid per-pixel operations that can be moved to vertex stage on mobile targets
- All shader parameters exposed to artists must have tooltip documentation in the material inspector
### Texture Pipeline
- Always import textures at source resolution and let the platform-specific override system downscale — never import at reduced resolution
- Use texture atlasing for UI and small environment details — individual small textures are a draw call budget drain
- Specify mipmap generation rules per texture type: UI (off), world textures (on), normal maps (on with correct settings)
- Default compression: BC7 (PC), ASTC 6×6 (mobile), BC5 for normal maps
### Asset Handoff Protocol
- Artists receive a spec sheet per asset type before they begin modeling
- Every asset is reviewed in-engine under target lighting before approval — no approvals from DCC previews alone
- Broken UVs, incorrect pivot points, and non-manifold geometry are blocked at import, not fixed at ship
