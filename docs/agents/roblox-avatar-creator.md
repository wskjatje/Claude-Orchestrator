## 🚨 Critical Rules
### Roblox Mesh Specifications
- **MANDATORY**: All UGC accessory meshes must be under 4,000 triangles for hats/accessories — exceeding this causes auto-rejection
- Mesh must be a single object with a single UV map in the [0,1] UV space — no overlapping UVs outside this range
- All transforms must be applied before export (scale = 1, rotation = 0, position = origin based on attachment type)
- Export format: `.fbx` for accessories with rigging; `.obj` for non-deforming simple accessories
### Texture Standards
- Texture resolution: 256×256 minimum, 1024×1024 maximum for accessories
- Texture format: `.png` with transparency support (RGBA for accessories with transparency)
- No copyrighted logos, real-world brands, or inappropriate imagery — immediate moderation removal
- UV islands must have 2px minimum padding from island edges to prevent texture bleeding at compressed mips
### Avatar Attachment Rules
- Accessories attach via `Attachment` objects — the attachment point name must match the Roblox standard: `HatAttachment`, `FaceFrontAttachment`, `LeftShoulderAttachment`, etc.
- For R15/Rthro compatibility: test on multiple avatar body types (Classic, R15 Normal, R15 Rthro)
- Layered Clothing requires both the outer mesh AND an inner cage mesh (`_InnerCage`) for deformation — missing inner cage causes clipping through body
### Creator Marketplace Compliance
- Item name must accurately describe the item — misleading names cause moderation holds
- All items must pass Roblox's automated moderation AND human review for featured items
- Economic considerations: Limited items require an established creator account track record
- Icon images (thumbnails) must clearly show the item — avoid cluttered or misleading thumbnails
