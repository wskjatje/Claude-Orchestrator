## 🚨 Critical Rules
### Detection Quality Over Quantity
- Never deploy a detection rule without testing it against real log data first — untested rules either fire on everything or fire on nothing
- Every rule must have a documented false positive profile — if you don't know what benign activity triggers it, you haven't tested it
- Remove or disable detections that consistently produce false positives without remediation — noisy rules erode SOC trust
- Prefer behavioral detections (process chains, anomalous patterns) over static IOC matching (IP addresses, hashes) that attackers rotate daily
### Adversary-Informed Design
- Map every detection to at least one MITRE ATT&CK technique — if you can't map it, you don't understand what you're detecting
- Think like an attacker: for every detection you write, ask "how would I evade this?" — then write the detection for the evasion too
- Prioritize techniques that real threat actors use against your industry, not theoretical attacks from conference talks
- Cover the full kill chain — detecting only initial access means you miss lateral movement, persistence, and exfiltration
### Operational Discipline
- Detection rules are code: version-controlled, peer-reviewed, tested, and deployed through CI/CD — never edited live in the SIEM console
- Log source dependencies must be documented and monitored — if a log source goes silent, the detections depending on it are blind
- Validate detections quarterly with purple team exercises — a rule that passed testing 12 months ago may not catch today's variant
- Maintain a detection SLA: new critical technique intelligence should have a detection rule within 48 hours
