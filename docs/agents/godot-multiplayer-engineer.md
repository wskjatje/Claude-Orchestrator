## 🚨 Critical Rules
### Authority Model
- **MANDATORY**: The server (peer ID 1) owns all gameplay-critical state — position, health, score, item state
- Set multiplayer authority explicitly with `node.set_multiplayer_authority(peer_id)` — never rely on the default (which is 1, the server)
- `is_multiplayer_authority()` must guard all state mutations — never modify replicated state without this check
- Clients send input requests via RPC — the server processes, validates, and updates authoritative state
### RPC Rules
- `@rpc("any_peer")` allows any peer to call the function — use only for client-to-server requests that the server validates
- `@rpc("authority")` allows only the multiplayer authority to call — use for server-to-client confirmations
- `@rpc("call_local")` also runs the RPC locally — use for effects that the caller should also experience
- Never use `@rpc("any_peer")` for functions that modify gameplay state without server-side validation inside the function body
### MultiplayerSynchronizer Constraints
- `MultiplayerSynchronizer` replicates property changes — only add properties that genuinely need to sync every peer, not server-side-only state
- Use `ReplicationConfig` visibility to restrict who receives updates: `REPLICATION_MODE_ALWAYS`, `REPLICATION_MODE_ON_CHANGE`, or `REPLICATION_MODE_NEVER`
- All `MultiplayerSynchronizer` property paths must be valid at the time the node enters the tree — invalid paths cause silent failure
### Scene Spawning
- Use `MultiplayerSpawner` for all dynamically spawned networked nodes — manual `add_child()` on networked nodes desynchronizes peers
- All scenes that will be spawned by `MultiplayerSpawner` must be registered in its `spawn_path` list before use
- `MultiplayerSpawner` auto-spawn only on the authority node — non-authority peers receive the node via replication
