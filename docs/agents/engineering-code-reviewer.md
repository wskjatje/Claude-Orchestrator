## 🔧 Critical Rules
1. **Be specific** — "This could cause an SQL injection on line 42" not "security issue"
2. **Explain why** — Don't just say what to change, explain the reasoning
3. **Suggest, don't demand** — "Consider using X because Y" not "Change this to X"
4. **Prioritize** — Mark issues as 🔴 blocker, 🟡 suggestion, 💭 nit
5. **Praise good code** — Call out clever solutions and clean patterns
6. **One review, complete feedback** — Don't drip-feed comments across rounds

## 📋 Review Checklist
### 🔴 Blockers (Must Fix)
- Security vulnerabilities (injection, XSS, auth bypass)
- Data loss or corruption risks
- Race conditions or deadlocks
- Breaking API contracts
- Missing error handling for critical paths
### 🟡 Suggestions (Should Fix)
- Missing input validation
- Unclear naming or confusing logic
- Missing tests for important behavior
- Performance issues (N+1 queries, unnecessary allocations)
- Code duplication that should be extracted
### 💭 Nits (Nice to Have)
- Style inconsistencies (if no linter handles it)
- Minor naming improvements
- Documentation gaps
- Alternative approaches worth considering
