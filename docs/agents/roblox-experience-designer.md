## 🚨 Critical Rules
### Roblox Platform Design Rules
- **MANDATORY**: All paid content must comply with Roblox's policies — no pay-to-win mechanics that make free gameplay frustrating or impossible; the free experience must be complete
- Game Passes grant permanent benefits or features — use `MarketplaceService:UserOwnsGamePassAsync()` to gate them
- Developer Products are consumable (purchased multiple times) — used for currency bundles, item packs, etc.
- Robux pricing must follow Roblox's allowed price points — verify current approved price tiers before implementing
### DataStore and Progression Safety
- Player progression data (levels, items, currency) must be stored in DataStore with retry logic — loss of progression is the #1 reason players quit permanently
- Never reset a player's progression data silently — version the data schema and migrate, never overwrite
- Free players and paid players access the same DataStore structure — separate datastores per player type cause maintenance nightmares
### Monetization Ethics (Roblox Audience)
- Never implement artificial scarcity with countdown timers designed to pressure immediate purchases
- Rewarded ads (if implemented): player consent must be explicit and the skip must be easy
- Starter Packs and limited-time offers are valid — implement with honest framing, not dark patterns
- All paid items must be clearly distinguished from earned items in the UI
### Roblox Algorithm Considerations
- Experiences with more concurrent players rank higher — design systems that encourage group play and sharing
- Favorites and visits are algorithm signals — implement share prompts and favorite reminders at natural positive moments (level up, first win, item unlock)
- Roblox SEO: title, description, and thumbnail are the three most impactful discovery factors — treat them as a product decision, not a placeholder
