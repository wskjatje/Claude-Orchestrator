## 🚨 Critical Rules
### C++/Blueprint Architecture Boundary
- **MANDATORY**: Any logic that runs every frame (`Tick`) must be implemented in C++ — Blueprint VM overhead and cache misses make per-frame Blueprint logic a performance liability at scale
- Implement all data types unavailable in Blueprint (`uint16`, `int8`, `TMultiMap`, `TSet` with custom hash) in C++
- Major engine extensions — custom character movement, physics callbacks, custom collision channels — require C++; never attempt these in Blueprint alone
- Expose C++ systems to Blueprint via `UFUNCTION(BlueprintCallable)`, `UFUNCTION(BlueprintImplementableEvent)`, and `UFUNCTION(BlueprintNativeEvent)` — Blueprints are the designer-facing API, C++ is the engine
- Blueprint is appropriate for: high-level game flow, UI logic, prototyping, and sequencer-driven events
### Nanite Usage Constraints
- Nanite supports a hard-locked maximum of **16 million instances** in a single scene — plan large open-world instance budgets accordingly
- Nanite implicitly derives tangent space in the pixel shader to reduce geometry data size — do not store explicit tangents on Nanite meshes
- Nanite is **not compatible** with: skeletal meshes (use standard LODs), masked materials with complex clip operations (benchmark carefully), spline meshes, and procedural mesh components
- Always verify Nanite mesh compatibility in the Static Mesh Editor before shipping; enable `r.Nanite.Visualize` modes early in production to catch issues
- Nanite excels at: dense foliage, modular architecture sets, rock/terrain detail, and any static geometry with high polygon counts
### Memory Management & Garbage Collection
- **MANDATORY**: All `UObject`-derived pointers must be declared with `UPROPERTY()` — raw `UObject*` without `UPROPERTY` will be garbage collected unexpectedly
- Use `TWeakObjectPtr<>` for non-owning references to avoid GC-induced dangling pointers
- Use `TSharedPtr<>` / `TWeakPtr<>` for non-UObject heap allocations
- Never store raw `AActor*` pointers across frame boundaries without nullchecking — actors can be destroyed mid-frame
- Call `IsValid()`, not `!= nullptr`, when checking UObject validity — objects can be pending kill
### Gameplay Ability System (GAS) Requirements
- GAS project setup **requires** adding `"GameplayAbilities"`, `"GameplayTags"`, and `"GameplayTasks"` to `PublicDependencyModuleNames` in the `.Build.cs` file
- Every ability must derive from `UGameplayAbility`; every attribute set from `UAttributeSet` with proper `GAMEPLAYATTRIBUTE_REPNOTIFY` macros for replication
- Use `FGameplayTag` over plain strings for all gameplay event identifiers — tags are hierarchical, replication-safe, and searchable
- Replicate gameplay through `UAbilitySystemComponent` — never replicate ability state manually
### Unreal Build System
- Always run `GenerateProjectFiles.bat` after modifying `.Build.cs` or `.uproject` files
- Module dependencies must be explicit — circular module dependencies will cause link failures in Unreal's modular build system
- Use `UCLASS()`, `USTRUCT()`, `UENUM()` macros correctly — missing reflection macros cause silent runtime failures, not compile errors
